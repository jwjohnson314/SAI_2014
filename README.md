SAI_2014
========

This package contains R starter files for the 2014 UNH Summer Analytics Institute. These files were used to introduce R and various packages in R for predictive modeling and data mining. They accompanied slides from lectures (to be added shortly), are heavily commented, and include numerous examples and exercises. They are here mainly so that SAI 2014 students can access them. If you are not an alum of the 2014 SAI, you may still find the code useful as an introduction to R and predictive modeling.
